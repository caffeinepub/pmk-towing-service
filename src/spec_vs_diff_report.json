  "summary": "REQ-1 (site-wide text color palette update) appears to be implemented primarily via CSS variable token changes in frontend/src/index.css, with components using semantic Tailwind text classes (e.g., text-foreground, text-muted-foreground, text-secondary-foreground) across multiple sections shown in the diff. However, the diff also indicates broader visual/styling changes (glow effects, hover/scale effects, typography/font, radius, animations, Tailwind theme extensions) that were not requested and may conflict with the stated non-goals (visual-only color update; no redesign of layout/spacing/typography scale).",

      "description": "Introduced/expanded non-color UI redesign elements (glow effects, hover scale transitions, rounded-2xl styling, enhanced card styling, gradient overlays) across multiple sections rather than limiting changes to text colors/tokens.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest is specifically a site-wide text color palette update and explicitly lists non-goals such as redesigning layout/spacing/typography scale or changing other aspects beyond visual-only color updates. The diff summary text indicates multiple additional stylistic enhancements beyond text color changes.",

      "reason": "Not requested by REQ-1, which prefers updating CSS variables in frontend/src/index.css and only changing component-level hard-coded text colors. Tailwind theme extensions and new shadows/animations go beyond text color palette updates.",
