  "summary": "Implemented a new Photos section component and integrated it into the single-page homepage, plus added a new “Photos” smooth-scroll navigation item in both desktop and mobile header menus. However, the diff summary does not show the two uploaded image files being added under a public static assets path, so the static-asset inclusion portion of REQ-6 is not evidenced.",

      "reason": "PhotosSection references /assets/uploads/... paths, but the diff summary only shows a new TSX component and modifications to TSX/metadata files; it does not show the actual image files being added anywhere under frontend/public.",
